    "\n",
    "Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women. Prognostic biomarkers derived from high-throughput transcriptomic data can aid in identifying patient-specific survival outcomes and inform personalized treatments. This project analyzes TCGA-BRCA RNA-seq and clinical data to identify survival-associated genes using Cox proportional hazards models and explore their biological relevance through enrichment analysis.\n"
